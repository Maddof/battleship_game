# Battleship Game

A simple game where you play vs the AI. This was my return to javascript after several months break. This was a good, intermediate project that was good for refreshing my JavaScript knowledge.

## Learning

During this projet I learned and refreshed my basic knowledge on:

- Jest testing
- Object oriented programming in JavaScript

## Future features and improvement

Improving the computer AI.
Listing status of game and gameboard in UI.
Refactoring code to make it more modular and improve the dir structure.
General improvement in UI design. Better colors, animations etc.
